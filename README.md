# Opensource-Noise-Generation

Unity WebGL Noise Generation using a hexagonal mesh grid. Each hexagon is composed of six triangles. I use Unity's built in **Gouraud shading** included within the Unity mesh creator, 
this allows the gradient to be performed with no extra lines of code. This is more efficient than coding the gradient shaders.

## Features

- Procedurally generated **hexagonal grid** with per-triangle color variations.  
- Fully customizable in the Unity Editor: hex size, grid dimensions, and color options.  
- Open-source and feel free to modify or extend wtih credits to my github page Https://murugan47.github.io
